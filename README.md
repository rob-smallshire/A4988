# A4988

Status: Currently this code is pretty much untested (other than some ad hoc testing) and it yet to be used with real hardware.

Driver for A4988 stepper motor controller.  This is not so much as fork as a complete rewrite of the AccelStepper
library which improves the usability of the API, the capabilities of the controller, and the maintainability of the
code base.
